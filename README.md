About The Search:

I went through all the list to search using movie title, or by year, the sort them by rating and then group them by year with the limit of top 5

I could optimize it if it just the year by sort the movie list and apply Binary Search or if user search by title and get the result based on the order of search word, it could be applied through create a Binary Tree and make binary search too.

But here i could not know in which place i will search or i want to search by year or by title, so i had to go through the list event by filtering or maybe using regex.
